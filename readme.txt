I was able to create a socket from the serverSideCallback to the callbackServer, but only the first number was being sent through, and then I get an error message.
Also, my server does not properly handle and update multiple clients.
I did not have time to fix these issues.
To demonstrate a properly updating GUI, I included packages workingGUIview and workingGUIcontroller which work perfectly.
